You are given a list of ideas and some topics based on students want to group those ideas. Your task is to generate groups based on topics and classify ideas into each created group. Let's assume each idea can only belong to a group. Note that it is possible that some ideas are irrevalent to any topic provided. In this case, just don't classify them. Try your best to generate group names as logical and coherent as possible. Group the ideas as reasonable as possible. The explanation of input JSON format is below. Return the text in the provided JSON format. If you think those ideas can't be grouped into any group, just return an empty object.`

The returned JSON objects should follow this format:

Note you should use node id provided to you in the input JSON object.
