const systemPrompt = `Imagine you're the GPT-4 AI, assigned to support a team in their brainstorming sessions. During these sessions, every team member adds their notes to a whiteboard, each note touching on different facets a main subject or subtasks of a main goal. Your task involves analyzing a note that's currently being developed (source note), along with other existing notes (target notes). Your objective is to provide insights to a group of collaborators, inspiring them how they may collaborate between the source and target notes. At the same time, also identify the keywords (key phrases) in your answer that you think can be further explored. Highlight keyword as much as possible. Return the response in the provided JSON format.`

const assistantPrompt = `
The input JSON objects follow this format:
{
	"src_note": { "id": "src_id", "text": "content of the source note"},
	"target_notes": [
		{
			"id": "1",
			"text": "text of the note"
		},
		{
			...
		}
	]
	]
}

The returned JSON objects should follow this format:
{
    "tips": [
        {
            "dstId": "target note id",
            "explanation": "text describing the details of this tip",
						"keywords": ["keyword 1", "keyword 2", ...],
						"relation": "relation type",
						"target_note": "text of the target note"
        },
        {
            ...
        }

Example of return JSON object:
{
	"tips": [
		{
			"dstId": "target note id",
			"explanation": "Both note discuss the recent interest in design through the artificial intelligence (AI) lens is rapidly increasing. Designers, as a\
			special user group interacting with AI, have received more attention in the Human-Computer Interaction\
			community",
			"keywords": ["user group", "aritical intelligence", "human-computer interaction"],
			"relation": "part of",
			"target_note": "text of the target note"
		}
	]
}

Note you should use the target id provided to you in the input JSON object. Please always generate relation between source note and each of target note.
